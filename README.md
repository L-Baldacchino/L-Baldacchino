# 💫 About Me:
👋 Hey there! I'm a Software Engineering with a passion for building mobile and web apps that solve real problems. I’m especially interested in AI, automation, and finding clever ways to make life (and code) more efficient.<br><br>💻 I mostly work with Python, JavaScript, React and React Native, and I'm always looking to learn new tools and tech.<br><br>🚀 Currently at the very early stages of building my own startup (Tera Apps), figuring things out one experiment at a time.<br><br>📚 When I’m not coding, you’ll probably find me reading about productivity or tending to my chilli plants (they're almost as spicy as my GitHub commits 🌶️).
